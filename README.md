**Abstract.** Mexico’s intermunicipal mobility network reveals a sharp contrast in the pandemic’s effects. Using 731 daily networks from 2020 to 2021 and a component decomposition approach, the analysis shows
that local components, representing short-distance travel, were heavily disrupted by mobility restrictions, leading to reduced connectivity and smaller community sizes. Meanwhile, global components, reflecting long-distance movement, remained resilient and structurally stable.
These findings highlight how external shocks like COVID-19 disproportionately impact local versus global mobility, revealing the robustness of long-distance networks in times of crisis.
